		<t id="1801">[justify][author]\033CEngineer[/author]Sir,\n\nmy team has installed \033C{1}\033X special scanner on your ship.\n\n\033WYou have acquired a Data Scanner. This device allows you to scan any ship in order to unlock its blueprint for construction in your future Outposts. Unlike cargo scanning, data scanning is a safe and free process. To start scanning a ship, you must first assign a special hotkey from the Control settings menu, at the bottom of the Interface tab. Scanning takes some time and to unlock a blueprint, you often need multiple scans on different ships of the same type. This can already unlock smaller ships, but for bigger types you`ll need to build Research stations in your sectors. Note that if you lose your Data Scanner, you will be able to make another one from your Outposts. Be careful though, it`s an expensive equipment![/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="1802">[author]\033WTutorial[/author]\n[center]\033YFirst steps[/center][justify]\n\n\n\033WMayhem includes a lot of redesigned menus and hotkeys. Go to your Controls settings, Interface tab, then you`ll find all the new hotkeys at the bottom. Start with the personal console. From there you can reach almost everything else.\n\nThe galaxy will not change much until you complete your Ascension goals. This is your path to become a leader again and control territory.\nRegardless of which Ascension path you have chosen, there are certain things which are always recommended to prepare your future empire building. Don`t focus too much on any single aspect.\n\nExplore!\nIt`s important to get to know the galaxy map and sector stats. For the most part you don`t need to know whats exactly in all those sectors.\nYou also DON`T need a satellite network  yet. Right now your ships can`t quickly reach distant sectors anyway. Too many early satellites just waste time and money.\n\nCollect Ships!\nYour empire requires a few haulers and also military ships to defend your sectors. Check your message log for a Remnant Signal hint. With at least 2 haulers and half a dozen fighters you should be prepared for what`s to come after the Ascension.\nBut keep an eye on your maintenance cost. At this stage it is often not worth it to keep very expensive ships like M6, because they can`t catch quick pirates and generally don`t do anything useful for you yet. Don`t fear loosing ships. In Mayhem 3 you generally can`t loose hours of progress that easily.\n\nEarn Money!\nInitially you will need to buy important resources and constantly pay upkeep. There are plenty of ways and additional early game activities to make money.\nRegister your ship for cargo smuggling or passenger taxi transport. Missions can only be accepted when actually docking and they are tracked by Mayhems own custom journal in your player console.\nEarly trading yields much more relative value than it does in other mods, even if the competition from other traders can be tough in areas around neutral corporation stations with their additional traders. Don`t shy away from buying something at a higher than average price! Even small margins can be much more valuable than it might seem at first.\nLoot and bailed ships can often be found in invasion sectors. Check your sector list in the ministry of war to find these. You can also search for HOT alert levels on the galaxy map. These are the locations where some fighting is going on. Weapon loot can only be sold at Markus corporation trading stations which are often located in Imperial space.\n\nRaise Reputation!\nIt`s absolutely NOT important to reach high ranks with major factions. That doesn`t unlock any new ships or items to buy. You mostly just need to make sure that your reputation doesn`t get negtative until you`ve established yourself.\nYou will need a certain reputation reserve to use as a diplomatic currency. Upon conquering sectors which are adjacent to other factions you have to spend some reputation points to prevent that they get mad and attack you.\nActivities which earn money are usually also good souces of reputation. Missions and taxi transport are some of the best early game options. But killing enemies for the faction you want to be best buddies with is even better.\n\n\nIf you need to read this message again, you`ll find it in your message log.\n\nGood luck![/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="1803">[justify][author]\033WTutorial[/author]\033WAs a private pilot, you are not allowed to dock to the Outposts of other factions. These stations have additional trading restrictions. Which means that they don`t just sell everything they have on stock to you. They will try to keep certain amounts of important strategic resources for themselves and they also won`t buy stupidly large amounts of all the crap you might be trying to sell to them.\n\nSo what you can never do in Mayhem is simply docking a ship to a faction outpost and trade goods like usual with the slider. It doesn`t matter if that is your playership or some other ship you control remotely. There are only two ways how you can trade with outposts.\n\n1\) using Trade Run: Buy or Sell commands\n2\) automated Trader Worker ships which must be homebased to your own stations.\n\nBoth of these commands have to respect the additional trade restrictions. So for example when the Trade Run can`t to buy some resource from, this doesn`t mean that nobody has this resource on stock. It just means that nobody wants to sell it to you because he doesn`t even have enough for his own demand.\nThe Station Information screen in your player console can show you this additional layer of trade thresholds for each station.\n\nThe fact that there is a real economy remains important throughout the entire game. Many of the former magic resource sinks are not available! That means that you should try to build a balanced economy according to actual demand and not just focus too much on mass producing a few products which make the most money! You might not be able to sell them in sufficient numbers![/justify]</t>
		<t id="1805">[justify][author]\033WTutorial[/author]\033WYou have just built your first Outpost, congratulations!\n\nYour first Outpost contains some precious resources to get you started; use them to build your first stations and ships. At this point, you should get more station crafting resources. But very soon you also need to worry about basic defense. A small fighter wing is usually enough to deal with stray pirate scum.\n\nDepending how dangerous your starting location is, you might want to keep an eye on your TS ships at first. If you send them out to buy valuable resources from other factions and they have to cross unknown sectors, then it`s often advisable to form convoy groups and have all your few military ships follow as protection. Buy what you need and then return with the entire group.\n\nYou are now able to setup automated ships, called Workers. As a rule of thumb you should own about 100.000 credits of spare cash for each Trader worker. If you don`t have that much, it may be wise to delay your first Traders, as these ships require some investment before they can bring you the first profits. Consider starting with a Tug or Looter Worker. The former can be an M5 for speed \(Tugs don`t need to be carriers\), the latter a TS for cargo or a M6 for survivability.\n\nYour Workers can be killed by Pirates or Sith patrols. When dangerous sectors are identified, you can either blacklist them, or build a small group of fighters to escort your most precious Workers. You can even turn the worker into a fleet commander and setup advanced fleet features for his escort.\n\nWhen you`re ready to build your first Traders, you should adjust their allowed budget by going into the Logistics-&gt;Traders section, and change the `External trade: import maximum value` setting to a lower value. You don`t want them to spend all your money on a single trade!\n\nDon`t be too quick when choosing your first perks. Leaving 1 slot open for some time is actually a wise decision. The No Food Consumption perk is often a great early choice, because it saves you a lot of money and makes your future sector choices much more flexible.\n\nWhile everything is being setup, you should continue to earn money and reputation, or scan some important ships, such as miners. After a few hours, you should start thinking about your global strategy; where to build your next Outposts, what ships to research, what investments you want to make, etc.\n\nGood luck![/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="1806">[justify][author]\033GVolkhart[/author]Glad to have you back, boss!\n\nLet me fill you in about the political situation in these parts.\n\nEntire star systems of different factions arrived here roughly a year ago. They all brought their different backgrounds and feuds with them. I see an age of war coming.\n\nThose who came from a more advanced timeline could piece our shared history together. They told everyone about the Infinite Empire of the Rakata, about the Jedi on Tython. Stories from the Old Republic against the ancient Sith. The Mandalorian wars, all the way to the proclamation of the first Galactic Empire and its fall.\n\nOur team wasn`t slacking, boss. We already made some contacts. This entire situation is a great opportunity to build our own empire among the others!\n\nAccording to our analysts, the other factions are still quite cautious. The intensity of all fighting is still low. We can expect that they will change their fleet doctrines and build new ship types over time. Like it happened historically in the old world, just much faster. Too much advanced knowledge got stranded here. The technology is already circulating and you can`t keep that a secret forever. Make sure to use your new Data Scanner to gather some of that tech for our science division. We`re gonna need it later.\n\nA particularly aggresive group of mandalorian Death Watch has recently started to conduct terrorist attacks on various stations. We don`t know yet what they want to achieve. But they seem to get along well with the usual criminal scum.\n\nThen we got hostile ships of Sith origin all around the galaxy. Nobody knows if they are just fanatics or even controlled by droids. But so far every attempt to communicate has failed. Historians from a very knowledgable era in the New Republic have established the theory that they come from an ancient automated Rakata factory called the Starforge. The only concern of this faction seems to expand and extract resources from entire planets to create copies of themselves.\n\nAll major corporations have formed a large association called THE CARTELL. They could strike a deal with everyone, even with these Sith! They leave them alone. The cartell got everyone by the balls because of that. Most supply lines are still too fragile and major factions depend too much on Cartell shipping services. This allowed them to enforce certain rules on the galaxy to ensure constant profits. With all that money they employ mercenary groups which we could also hire.\n\nCertain actions like scanning without a police license or destroying property that the Cartell has currently put under protectorate are forbidden and get punished with a fine![/justify]\n\n</t>
		<t id="1807">[justify][author]\033GVolkhart[/author]I got troubling news, boss.\n\nThe Star Forge has gone completely haywire. It must`ve overloaded its internal processing facilities. We should prepare for galaxy wide Sith invasions. Sectors with high abnormal signals seem to be most affected.\n\nYou must lead us through these dark times![/justify]\n</t>

Expect more [yellow]militarization across all factions[/yellow]. But they will need long to build up first. That may give these new arrivals some time to rampage almost unchallenged!\n\nWe should remain cautious until we`ve put all this into perspective. We must learn who this leader is and what he is up to. And maybe you should take a look on the galaxy map. He just repainted it quite a bit. If he truly is a puppet master for criminals we might want to avoid any areas he has just taken over. Consider to put this entire mandalorian faction on the blacklist, boss. And maybe additional sectors at their border. Just to keep our workers safe. At least until the dust has settled.[/justify]</t>
		<t id="2219">[justify][author]\033GBreaking News[/author]Dear citizens!\n\nIt`s a great day today, as the Sith portals have all just vanished from our galaxy! Our scientists are still not able to explain this phenomenon, nor deny if whether or not it is permanent, but they seem to be rather confident and full of hope for our future. They`ve also managed to extract precious data from the Sith ships.\n\n\033WCongratulations, you have defeated the Sith in this galaxy! As a reward, you can now research all Sith ships.[/justify]</t>
		<t id="2225">[justify][author]\033MThe Cartell[/author]Dear pilot,\n\nYou have been authorized to participate in the expansion of this universe! The recent registration of your ship will let you trade, fight and expand in your outer border galaxy. You`ve chosen to be an independent and as such, you have a special role to play. Your task will be harder and you will have less support than other factions, but if you manage to build a respectable empire, the Cartell and all its subsidiaries could entrust you with the important mission of terraforming new planets. But for now, we`ll monitor all your actions and we`ll contact you again if you are worth of our attention.[/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="2226">[justify][author]\033MThe Cartell[/author]Dear pilot,\n\nIn the light of recent events, we have decided to speed things up. It is now time to discuss your future among the galaxy.\n\nWe are now giving you the ability to order a terraforming mission on the planets you control. Once an order has been given, our terraformers will teleport there and start the process. During this time, the ancient Star Forge could be awaken and will probably attack the sector. Hold tight, defend your assets and keep an eye on the abnormal signals displayed on your galaxy map. These signals can be used to encrypt transmissions. They may be a good indication of how strong the Star Forge can respond in the sector. Also, if the signals are low, we will be able to terraform the planet faster.\n\nWe want you to terraform %s planets. Do that, and we may be able to help your little empire.\n\n\033WYou can access the terraforming menu through the Sectors section of the Ministry Of War.\n\n\033WFinishing this mission will certainly cause a long lasting response from the ancient Star Forge. Be prepared. Though in SWM3 these attacks are much weaker. They are less of an existential threat to the galaxy and more a disruption for the factions. So don`t be afraid either.[/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="2227">[justify][author]\033MThe Cartell[/author]Dear pilot,\n\nYou have done a great job helping us terraforming your planets. Unfortunately, the Star Forge is too much of a threat in this area for us to invest more time into your installations. We leave you a team of specialists in case you would like to terraform more planets. Good luck.[/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="2232">[justify][author]\033GBreaking News[/author]Dear citizens,\n\nWe are living dark times and as you read this message, the Death Watch has just arisen. The Mandalorians, financed by minor entities, or even intergalactic companies according to some rumours, just conquered different sectors in the whole galaxy, giving them a strong power in these days of suffering. We don`t know their objectives yet, but given their cruel history everyone should be ready for more war.[/justify]\n</t>

		<t id="2704">Captain, our IT team has identified a virus that is rapidly spreading through all our systems. The code has the signature of the Sith and we think that the main targets are our ships. We should stop all ship production until this problem is fixed. Fortunately, all previous ships built from our Outpost are safe.\n</t>
