		<t id="6">Hey boss! Subspace radio chatter just stepped up tenfold! The Mandalorians have started their insurrection across multiple sectors! It`s wierd. They praise some hero all the time. Apparently this guy orchestrated all these strange terrorist attacks on the local economy from before. Not only did he have the pirate gangs in his pocket all along! No, he also built warfleets in secret!\n\nOur analysts predict that the other main factions will spread fear among their citizens in order to drive war support through the roof. [yellow]Expect more militarization across all factions.[/yellow] But they will need long to build up first. That may give these new arrivals some time to rampage almost unchallenged!\n\nWe should remain cautious until we`ve put all this into perspective. We must learn who this leader is and what he is up to.</t>
		<t id="7">And here we go. Our mysterious hero has sent a special offer.\n\n\n[yellow]To see this special offer go to your journal \(player console\) and click on the mission entry.[/yellow]</t>
		<t id="8">[author]\033RMandalore the Ultimate[/author]So you have chosen to ignore me, yes? That's pretty bold of you. Your insolence makes me chuckle a bit.\n\nBut don't fool yourself! Get in my way or hinder the Crusade and i will end you!\n\nLets see how long we get along.</t>
		<t id="9">[author]\033RMandalore the Ultimate[/author]Well, well, well... Seems like we got a real hero right here. Prepare yourself for glorious battle!\n\n\n[yellow]!!! Strategy advice: !!![/yellow]\nIts likely that the Mandalorians will expand further. This will take them long, but IF they can establish a sizable empire they will stop attacking other factions and focus entirely on annihilating YOU completely. Their deep strike fleets will invade your sectors wherever they might be. Your only chance to end this is to steadily expand your empire in order to reach the final plot stage. This will stop the Mandalorians from attacking only you and they will invade other factions again. Their other enemies will also become much stronger which should help you.</t>
		<t id="10">[author]\033RMandalore the Ultimate[/author]Yes. Let us fuel the flames of war together! My pirate raiders are putting their weapons down and have been sent over to help make your outposts more efficient. The Keldabe i promised to you is waiting in one of our sectors.\nTell us if you need protection or if we should leave certain sectors for you to claim.\nI expect that you immediately start to bring glory to our Crusade!\n\n\n[yellow]!!! Strategy advice: !!![/yellow]\nYour empire has just been supercharged for a quick military rush. The outposts you have right now can produce cheaper and quicker than any other outpost. So try to build all your ships in these original outposts. These are forever the most valuable part of your empire. Never loose them if possible!\n\nFrom now on you only have a single remaining allied faction. But you are a powerful team because you can influence them in the Ministry of War! Call for help, trader priority, satellite service. Or even give them invasion targets by letting them know what sectors they should attack or keep for you to claim.\n\nAll other factions want you dead and they are slowly growing their forces stronger as you read this. Right now most of them are still super weak, so try to conquer many sectors quickly!\n\nYou only have 2 days until the final plot stage gets activated. This will make your enemies very strong and your Mandalorian friends weak. You should help them to grow larger during the next couple days! Now is the time to get a decent headstart by conquering lots of territory!</t>
		<t id="11">[author]\033RMandalore the Ultimate[/author]Understood, you don't want to get involved. This works for me. Your small empire is no worthy opponent anyway. I've instructed my officers to ravage your territory less. But a few of us will just ignore me and go raiding your sectors as pirates anyway. And i won't stop them. Taking from the weak is in a Mandalorians nature.\n\nAnd just a fair warning. If you ever get in my way or hinder our Crusade. Lets just say that wouldn't be too healthy for you, shall we?</t>
		<t id="12">[author]\033RMandalore the Ultimate[/author]The Mandalorians have grown strong. Nothing will stop our Crusade. You should've killed us when you had the chance.\n\nPrepare to die!\n\n\n[yellow]!!! Strategy advice: !!![/yellow]\nTheir empire has become too large and confident. This is bad news for you. Your feud with their leader is not forgotten. Now he is after you!\nMandalorian battlegroups have deep strike ability. They can reach your sectors even over long distance! The Mandalorians won't launch any more invasions against other factions. You alone have become their only prime target.\n\nThere is only way to stop them. You must reach the lategame. This will weaken them considerably and also beef up their enemies. There are two ways to get to the lategame. Conquer 20 sectors or complete the terraforming quest.\n\n[red]Whatever you've been doing, get the move on right now or face annihilation !!![/red]</t>
		<t id="13">[author]\033GVolkhart[/author]Quick reminder about the Mandalorian offer, boss. We only got [red]1 hour left[/red]. If we don't make a decision we will stay neutral.

	<page id="9972" title="Mayhem 3" desc="" voice="no">
		<t id="1801">[justify][author]\033CEngineer[/author]Sir,\n\nmy team has installed \033C{1}\033X special scanner on your ship.\n\n\033WYou have acquired a Data Scanner. This device allows you to scan any ship in order to unlock its blueprint for construction in your future Outposts. Unlike cargo scanning, data scanning is a safe and free process. To start scanning a ship, you must first assign a special hotkey from the Control settings menu, at the bottom of the Interface tab. Scanning takes some time and to unlock a blueprint, you often need multiple scans on different ships of the same type. This can already unlock smaller ships, but for bigger types you`ll need to build Research stations in your sectors. Note that if you lose your Data Scanner, you will be able to make another one from your Outposts. Be careful though, it`s an expensive equipment![/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="1802">[author]\033WTutorial[/author]\n[center]\033YFirst steps[/center][justify]\n\n\n\033WMayhem includes a lot of redesigned menus and hotkeys. Go to your Controls settings, Interface tab, then you`ll find all the new hotkeys at the bottom. Start with the personal console. From there you can reach almost everything else.\n\nThe galaxy will not change much until you complete your Ascension goals. This is your path to become a leader again and control territory.\nRegardless of which Ascension path you have chosen, there are certain things which are always recommended to prepare your future empire building. Don`t focus too much on any single aspect.\n\nExplore!\nIt`s important to get to know the galaxy map and sector stats. For the most part you don`t need to know whats exactly in all those sectors.\nYou also DON`T need a satellite network  yet. Right now your ships can`t quickly reach distant sectors anyway. Too many early satellites just waste time and money.\n\nCollect Ships!\nYour empire requires a few haulers and also military ships to defend your sectors. Check your message log for a Remnant Signal hint. With at least 2 haulers and half a dozen fighters you should be prepared for what`s to come after the Ascension.\nBut keep an eye on your maintenance cost. At this stage it is often not worth it to keep very expensive ships like M6, because they can`t catch quick pirates and generally don`t do anything useful for you yet. Don`t fear loosing ships. In Mayhem 3 you generally can`t loose hours of progress that easily.\n\nEarn Money!\nInitially you will need to buy important resources and constantly pay upkeep. There are plenty of ways and additional early game activities to make money.\nRegister your ship for cargo smuggling or passenger taxi transport. Missions can only be accepted when actually docking and they are tracked by Mayhems own custom journal in your player console.\nEarly trading yields much more relative value than it does in other mods, even if the competition from other traders can be tough in areas around neutral corporation stations with their additional traders. Don`t shy away from buying something at a higher than average price! Even small margins can be much more valuable than it might seem at first.\nLoot and bailed ships can often be found in invasion sectors. Check your sector list in the ministry of war to find these. You can also search for HOT alert levels on the galaxy map. These are the locations where some fighting is going on. Weapon loot can only be sold at Markus corporation trading stations which are often located in Imperial space.\n\nRaise Reputation!\nIt`s absolutely NOT important to reach high ranks with major factions. That doesn`t unlock any new ships or items to buy. You mostly just need to make sure that your reputation doesn`t get negtative until you`ve established yourself.\nYou will need a certain reputation reserve to use as a diplomatic currency. Upon conquering sectors which are adjacent to other factions you have to spend some reputation points to prevent that they get mad and attack you.\nActivities which earn money are usually also good souces of reputation. Missions and taxi transport are some of the best early game options. But killing enemies for the faction you want to be best buddies with is even better.\n\n\nIf you need to read this message again, you`ll find it in your message log.\n\nGood luck![/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="1803">[justify][author]\033WTutorial[/author]\033WAs a private pilot, you are not allowed to dock to the Outposts of other factions. These stations have additional trading restrictions. Which means that they don`t just sell everything they have on stock to you. They will try to keep certain amounts of important strategic resources for themselves and they also won`t buy stupidly large amounts of all the crap you might be trying to sell to them.\n\nSo what you can never do in Mayhem is simply docking a ship to a faction outpost and trade goods like usual with the slider. It doesn`t matter if that is your playership or some other ship you control remotely. There are only two ways how you can trade with outposts.\n\n1\) using Trade Run: Buy or Sell commands\n2\) automated Trader Worker ships which must be homebased to your own stations.\n\nBoth of these commands have to respect the additional trade restrictions. So for example when the Trade Run can`t to buy some resource from, this doesn`t mean that nobody has this resource on stock. It just means that nobody wants to sell it to you because he doesn`t even have enough for his own demand.\nThe Station Information screen in your player console can show you this additional layer of trade thresholds for each station.\n\nThe fact that there is a real economy remains important throughout the entire game. Many of the former magic resource sinks are not available! That means that you should try to build a balanced economy according to actual demand and not just focus too much on mass producing a few products which make the most money! You might not be able to sell them in sufficient numbers![/justify]</t>
		<t id="1805">[justify][author]\033WTutorial[/author]\033WYou have just built your first Outpost, congratulations!\n\nYour first Outpost contains some precious resources to get you started; use them to build your first stations and ships. At this point, you should get more station crafting resources. But very soon you also need to worry about basic defense. A small fighter wing is usually enough to deal with stray pirate scum.\n\nDepending how dangerous your starting location is, you might want to keep an eye on your TS ships at first. If you send them out to buy valuable resources from other factions and they have to cross unknown sectors, then it`s often advisable to form convoy groups and have all your few military ships follow as protection. Buy what you need and then return with the entire group.\n\nYou are now able to setup automated ships, called Workers. As a rule of thumb you should own about 100.000 credits of spare cash for each Trader worker. If you don`t have that much, it may be wise to delay your first Traders, as these ships require some investment before they can bring you the first profits. Consider starting with a Tug or Looter Worker. The former can be an M5 for speed \(Tugs don`t need to be carriers\), the latter a TS for cargo or a M6 for survivability.\n\nYour Workers can be killed by Pirates or Sith patrols. When dangerous sectors are identified, you can either blacklist them, or build a small group of fighters to escort your most precious Workers. You can even turn the worker into a fleet commander and setup advanced fleet features for his escort.\n\nWhen you`re ready to build your first Traders, you should adjust their allowed budget by going into the Logistics-&gt;Traders section, and change the `External trade: import maximum value` setting to a lower value. You don`t want them to spend all your money on a single trade!\n\nDon`t be too quick when choosing your first perks. Leaving 1 slot open for some time is actually a wise decision. The No Food Consumption perk is often a great early choice, because it saves you a lot of money and makes your future sector choices much more flexible.\n\nWhile everything is being setup, you should continue to earn money and reputation, or scan some important ships, such as miners. After a few hours, you should start thinking about your global strategy; where to build your next Outposts, what ships to research, what investments you want to make, etc.\n\nGood luck![/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="1806">[justify][author]\033GVolkhart[/author]Glad to have you back, boss!\n\nLet me fill you in about the political situation in these parts.\n\nEntire star systems of different factions arrived here roughly a year ago. They all brought their different backgrounds and feuds with them. I see an age of war coming.\n\nThose who came from a more advanced timeline could piece our shared history together. They told everyone about the Infinite Empire of the Rakata, about the Jedi on Tython. Stories from the Old Republic against the ancient Sith. The Mandalorian wars, all the way to the proclamation of the first Galactic Empire and its fall.\n\nOur team wasn`t slacking, boss. We already made some contacts. This entire situation is a great opportunity to build our own empire among the others!\n\nAccording to our analysts, the other factions are still quite cautious. The intensity of all fighting is still low. We can expect that they will change their fleet doctrines and build new ship types over time. Like it happened historically in the old world, just much faster. Too much advanced knowledge got stranded here. The technology is already circulating and you can`t keep that a secret forever. Make sure to use your new Data Scanner to gather some of that tech for our science division. We`re gonna need it later.\n\nA particularly aggresive group of mandalorian Death Watch has recently started to conduct terrorist attacks on various stations. We don`t know yet what they want to achieve. But they seem to get along well with the usual criminal scum.\n\nThen we got hostile ships of Sith origin all around the galaxy. Nobody knows if they are just fanatics or even controlled by droids. But so far every attempt to communicate has failed. Historians from a very knowledgable era in the New Republic have established the theory that they come from an ancient automated Rakata factory called the Starforge. The only concern of this faction seems to expand and extract resources from entire planets to create copies of themselves.\n\nAll major corporations have formed a large association called THE CARTELL. They could strike a deal with everyone, even with these Sith! They leave them alone. The cartell got everyone by the balls because of that. Most supply lines are still too fragile and major factions depend too much on Cartell shipping services. This allowed them to enforce certain rules on the galaxy to ensure constant profits. With all that money they employ mercenary groups which we could also hire.\n\nCertain actions like scanning without a police license or destroying property that the Cartell has currently put under protectorate are forbidden and get punished with a fine![/justify]\n\n</t>
		<t id="1807">[justify][author]\033GVolkhart[/author]I got troubling news, boss.\n\nThe Star Forge has gone completely haywire. It must`ve overloaded its internal processing facilities. We should prepare for galaxy wide Sith invasions. Sectors with high abnormal signals seem to be most affected.\n\nYou must lead us through these dark times![/justify]\n</t>
		<t id="1808">[justify][author]\033GVolkhart[/author]Our science division just finished two prototype Jump Beacons! Our old ship based hyperdrives might have become useless, but we could effectively build a static hyperspace bridge between these portable devices!\n\nThe Rebel Alliance has a much more advanced version installed in their Outpost stations which works similar\nWe on the other hand have just entered this field of research. Before we start production we need to finish calibrating energy patterns for the prototype with very expensive and bulky lab equipment.\n\n\n\033YTo permanently unlock Jump Beacon construction we must first build an Outpost in any Hyperlane sector! The galaxy map shows you which sectors got this special trait.\n\n[/justify]
\n</t>
		<t id="1809">[justify][author]\033GVolkhart[/author]Jump Beacon calibrations are complete! The two prototypes have been stored in our new Outpost. To construct more of these portable new devices we must build a special factory for jump cores and use them in the mobile factory module for capships. I recommend to upgrade our TL soon, boss.\n\n\n\033YFuture Jump Beacon producion is unlocked! Simply drop them in space and all your ships will automatically treat them just like normal warpgates!\n\n\33YTo have your personal playership plot an autopilot path via Jump Beacons you have to bind a special hotkey in the interface extensions section.\n\n\n\33WMayhem 3 veterans who want additional challenge can go in the t-file and enable an option which additionally restricts jump beacons to only work between Hyperlane sectors! Highly recommended if you like having to adapt your strategy and solve logistical problems.\n\n[/justify]

It is [u]not recommended[/u] for new players.\n\n\033WCompleting your Ascension without Quickstart will reward you with 100,000 credits.\n
\n\033WMidgame Quickstart gives you everything you need for a healthy 4 sector player empire. A small military fleet with a capship, lots of freighters, miners, money, reputation, resources, blueprints, stations, and a special cheat TL which can load everything at once. This skips about 2-3 days of playtime \(most of the early game\) and lets you start more established. All your stations are still loaded up and you can choose your starting sectors \(once you've claimed your 4th sector, the SWM3 earlygame officially ends and the Mandalorians will arrive and cause more war\)</t>

They told us that this happens quite often. People arriving time-shifted that is.\n\nWe don`t know where we are. Must be the remotest, strangest part of the Unknown Regions, but heck! I`m not even sure if we are still in our own galaxy! I got to know this loaded Twi-Lek guy who claims that he already took shots during the Great Galactic War. That was thousands of years ago! And you know what. After seeing all this i do believe him!\n\nSome say it was a failed experiment at the imperial research facility near the Maw. Others claim it was caused by a powerful Sith Holocron. Whatever it was. We are now stuck here. And apparently there is no hope to return. We have to look forward. Thanks to you we already clawed our way to the top back in the old world. You can do it again! We are no longer bound by the rules of the %s! There are countless lost souls in need of strong leadership. Once you prove that you can give them purpose again, they will follow you.\n\n\n\033WThe Ascension is a set of goals that you can follow in the dedicated section of your Personal console.

		<!-- Galaxy -->
		<t id="1">Background Story</t>
		<t id="2">You start your journey as a member of one of the five main factions of the galaxy: Argon, Boron, Paranid, Split or Teladi. However, the galaxy you're living in is not a safe place. It's far away from the core Terran galaxies and every faction is fighting against each other for control and profits. You're living in one of the outer border galaxies ruled by Terracorp, a giant multigalactic company that is bound to the Terrans. They were once in charge of terraforming the planets that surround you, but it all failed when a devious AI took control of the Terraformer ships and created chaos. Today, the Commonwealth have been sent far away from the core galaxies and left there to fight internal wars and try to survive the Terraformer threats.\n\nYou are a nobody. However, your father were well known by some rebels that want you to form an independent faction and make the galaxy a better place.</t>
		<t id="3">Sector Stats</t>
		<t id="4">Each sector has different statistics displayed in the sector description of your galaxy map, or in the Ministry of War menu:\n\nPopulation: the maximum amount of people any Outpost can have.\n\nResearch rate: the speed at which your Research station will operate.\n\nStation support: the maximum number of stations allowed. This includes all docks and factories.\n\nDejure owner: when the AI decides to invade a sector, it looks at various things, including the sector value, which is greatly increased when the dejure owner is the same as their faction.\n\nCompany: if a company is assigned to a safe sector, a Trading station will appear. This station trades various wares that depends on the company.\n\nAbnormal signals: some dangerous threats could be more interested in sectors that have a stronger signal.\n\nTerran memory: there are no Terran ships in the galaxy you're living in, except for some of them that have been abandoned a long time ago when the Terrans were trying to terraform the planets. However, they have left some debris and wreckage that can help your Research stations in the studying of the Terran technologies.\n\nOutpost production and consumption: each Outpost produces a type of food, and consumes another one. The selection of this food depends on the sector.</t>
		<t id="5">Economy</t>
		<t id="6">The number of resources you can produce and trade have been greatly reduced to make the economy focus on the crafting part of the game. You'll notice that the price of everything has been adjusted and greatly lowered, as well as possible margins.\n\nBecause everything is now focused on crafting, every resource you see being transported is going to be used by either an Outpost to craft ships and stations, or another factory to manufacture a higher tier product.\n\nEvery ship comes from an Outpost and there is no artificial spawning. If you see a ship, that means that a faction has paid for it, with real resources.</t>
		<t id="7">Factions</t>
		<t id="8">The Commonwealth is composed of five factions: Galactic Empire, New Republic, Separatist CIS, Rebel Alliance and Republic. The Terraformers are composed of two factions: Sith and OCV. Then there are the Mandalorians as a special faction.\n\nEach faction of the Commonwealth start with their own territory and will fight to gain more sectors. For more information about that, see both Invasions and Squadrons sections.\n\nIf you're coming from LU, note that the Phanon Corporation no longer exists, and that the OCV is a total new faction that does not follow any of the past LU rules.</t>
		<t id="9">Missions</t>
		<t id="10">Vanilla missions have been replaced by a new system. There are 12 procedural missions:\n\nPatrol \(fight\): hunt Sith fleets in a given sector. The Sith will only appear when your own ship or any of your fleet leaders enters the sector. Each kill will grant you some credits and reputation, but you won't receive any if you just wait for other ships to do your job.\n\nSuppression \(fight\): factions are often at war against each other. This mission asks you to destroy existing ships of an enemy faction. The factions against whom you are in permanent war will be prioritized.\n\nBait \(fight\): capture a nearby abandoned miner ship to attract Kha'ak ships from deep space. Each kill will grant you some credits and reputation, and you will get the ship if you succeed in protecting it.\n\nDefense \(fight\): the Sith have built a jump beacon nearby and they are targetting a station. Protect the station and destroy the beacon.\n\nProvision \(trade\): a station needs various wares. You can deliver them with any of your ships. The reward is always based on the average price of all wares.\n\nAcquisition \(trade\): sometimes the AI will send his Tugs to capture abandoned ships. These ships can be used in their Outposts when needed, or sold to you through these missions.\n\nDeliveries \(trade\): a shady character will ask you to do multiple deliveries. Make sure you can defend yourself, as the parcels you ought to deliver are valuable to some pirates.\n\nProspecting \(think\): some asteroids need to be scanned in a given sector. If you've already scan all existing asteroids in this sector, new ones will be created.\n\nCollection \(think\): Artefacts have been dropped around a given sector. You must find them and bring them back to the station that gave you the mission. Artefacts come in a flying ware that the AI cannot loot.\n\nExploration \(think\): deploy Advanced satellites at given coordinates. An error margin of 5 km is allowed. Note that there is a command to move to coordinates in the Navigation section.\n\nRescue \(think\): capture an abandoned ship and get it back to its station, with all passengers alive onboard. As a reward, you can keep the ship.\n\nPolice \(think\): find a criminal and bring him to justice. As a reward, you can keep his ship.\n\nUnlike vanilla missions, you have to dock to the station to see the mission briefing and accept the offer, or abandon a mission you previously accepted. You can also use the Mission Briefing command that is available in the Additional Ship Commands section of the ship console. With that command, it is possible to accept a mission from any of your ships. Note that missions are generated when you enter a new sector and that they do not have a time limit.</t>
		<t id="11">Outposts</t>
		<t id="12">Outposts are the main stations of every faction, including yours. They serve as local headquarters and also as factories with their ability to build ships, lasers, missiles and shields. They are crucial in your development, because they represent the only way you have to build stations and ships.\n\nOutposts do not work magically. People live inside and work together to manufacture everything you need. In exchange, you must provide them with food if you do not want them to starve to death. Each Outpost produces a certain type of food and consumes another one, depending on the sector \(see the Sectors Stats section\). The consumption can be removed with the perk No Food Consumption.\n\nPeople can work on multiple projects at the same time without any penalty.\n\nOutposts can be affected by various events that will have unfortunate effects. The more people you have, the more chance you get of generating an event. You can restrict the maximum number of people in each of your Outpost through the Administration menu. You can avoid these events with the perk Insurance Policy.\n\nOnly Traders and ships that run a Trade Run commands can dock to NPC Outposts.</t>
		<t id="13">Companies</t>
		<t id="14">Companies are minor factions that stand neutral in the many wars that are fought over the galaxy. They have their own Trading stations that trade different wares depending on the company, and their own Traders that can survive any hostilities between two factions. They also have mercenaries that you can hire.\n\nCompanies are sector-based and will only build a Trading Station when the sector is safe, ie. not Unknown and not Sith. A sector you own is considered safe.\n\nDestroying company assets is illegal and is punished by a heavy fine.</t>
		
		<!-- Empire and Warfare -->
		<t id="1001">Expansion</t>
		<t id="1002">The general rule to expand your own empire is that you only need to unload an Outpost or a factory into an empty sector to conquer it. However, to expand into other territories, you first need to destroy all faction stations that are not owned by a company. Besides, capturing a new sector will cost you some reputation with adjacent owners \(except for the first one\). You must be very careful if you don't want to have a negative reputation with a neighbour, and risk of being attacked on sight by his ships.\n\nThrough your Personal console, you can abandon a sector you already own, or give it to another faction if your reputation is high enough.\n\nIn most games, other factions will not conquer any unknown sector if you don't capture one yourself first. Then they will adapt  to your pace and they will avoid conquering too many unknown sectors. The rate at which other factions conquer unknown sectors depends on the expansion of the galaxy: factions in "early" galaxies tend to conquer these sectors faster, but again, they will always scale to the number of sectors you own*. The only exception to this rule is in galaxies where the expansion has been set to "none"; in that case the other factions won't limit their expansion.\n\nDon't be too eager to conquer new sectors! Each of them can draw the attention of Sith or Pirates, and you better have enough firepower to defend your existing assets before going deeper into unknown territory.\n\n*This can be changed in the customizable 9972 t-file, id 251.</t>
		<t id="1003">Manufacture</t>
		<t id="1004">Crafting is one of the most important features of Mayhem. Ships, stations, shields, lasers, missiles and equipment can be crafted with various resources that you can all produce by building factories in your sectors. In Mayhem, Saturn Complex Hubs and Vanilla Complexes have been deactivated, but the costs of many things have been modified to keep the game balanced.\n\nAll crafting costs are based on the average price of the product you're trying to make, divided by the number of resources it requires.\n\nEach Outpost has its own specialization levels in different areas. The more projects you complete in a specific area \(ship, laser, missile, shield or station\) the better you become at it. By default, this bonus can go from 0% to 50%; that means that both resource and time costs will be reduced by this percentage.\nNote that new AI outposts always start at 50% specialization in all areas. They don't get better by completing projects, but they can still level up. There are special rules which are described in the 'Mechanics' section.\n\nCancelling a project will always give you back the resources you've invested.\n\nCrafting a ship requires people.</t>
		<t id="1005">Workers</t>
		<t id="1006">Workers are automated ships that are used to run your empire and make your life easier. Each Outpost, and some of your factories, have a limited number of slots to which you can assign different types of Workers. You can see these limitations, and other options, in the Administration tab of your Outposts.\n\nAgents: they operate either an Outpost or a factory. If affected to an Outpost, they will look for a job from the jobs list you define in the Logistics menu of the Outpost manager. If affected to a factory, they will look to import resources and export products to any of your other stations. Unlike Traders, Agents never trade with stations that you do not own. Agents are synchronized with each other, and also with Traders.\n\nExplorers: their only goal is to make sure that every reachable sector is monitored by an Advanced Satellite. If they can't find an Advanced Satellite from your own stations, they will wait until they do. They won't buy Satellites from other stations. Like every Worker, Explorers respect the "Max. sector distance for all Workers" setting of his station.\n\nLooters: they look for abandoned wares in all reachable sectors and bring them back to their homebase.\n\nMiners: when affected to an Outpost or a Quantum Tube Fab, they will mine the debris in the sector and unload their cargo to their homebase when full. Mobile mining fleets no longer exist. In Mayhem, only Ore and Silicon Wafers can be mined, as well as coloured crystals and minerals, that can be sold or used to craft equipment through your Outposts' hangars.\n\nTraders: ST and UT don't exist any more. Traders are the only Workers that can interact with factories you don't own. Other factions can send their own Traders to your Outposts if you allow them to. All Traders and Agents are synchronized with each other: they "lock" the ware in the station they're heading to, thus avoiding multiple Traders going to the same place for the same ware.\n\nTugs: they look for abandoned ships in all reachable sectors and bring them back to their homebase. Some mission ships or other special ships, such as the ones that emit a remnant signal, cannot be captured by Tugs.\n\nThe AI uses the exact same Workers as you, powered by the same scripts. The AI, however, has an additional Worker: the Service ships, that are only here to give some flavour to the game, without any particular effect.\n\nAll Workers respect the 'Max. sector distance' range setting of their homebase. For performance reasons, Agents and Traders will not go above 8 sectors. Jump beacons do not affect this range.</t>
		<t id="1007">Logistics</t>
		<t id="1008">There are two main screens that will help you to manage your logistics: the Agents menu and the Traders menu. Both are found in the Logistics tab of the Outpost manager. It's important to note that Agents only manage your own stations. If you want to interact with the stations of other factions, you'll need a Trader. The wares that Traders are allowed to exchange from and to your Outposts must be manually added to the Traders list. Each of your factories has import-export thresholds that you can set in their Station parameters menu. Agents and Traders will always check these thresholds: a first time before going there, and a second time on arrival \(export only\). Each Outpost and each factory can be configured to accept or forbid either your Traders or AI's Traders. When you build your first Outpost, it can be wise to allow other Traders to dock in order to buy the things you need from them, especially food.\n\nWhen an AI Trader comes to one of your stations, he can buy products or sell resources. If the station doesn't have enough money to buy all wares from a Trader, you will be notified \(your main account will NOT be debited\). Note that the AI will not trade at any price; its tolerance to unfair price is based on your trade rank. Fortunately there is an Automatic Pricing setting in all your factories. It is recommended to leave it on.\n\nAll Traders are synchronized and "lock" the station they're heading to, thus avoiding multiple Traders going to the same place for the same ware.\n\nEach station has a very important setting: "Max. sector distance for all Workers". This defines the range at which your Agents and Traders will look for trading partners, but not only, because all your Workers are affected by this value, including Explorers. Note that the "Reachable factories" job setting depends on that parameter as well.\n\nStation parameters can be modified either through the vanilla menu, or the new Station settings menu in your Personal console. Note that only through the latter it is possible to setup an automatic transfer of credits.</t>
		<t id="1009">Research</t>
		<t id="1010">The easiest way to acquire ships, other than capturing or buying them through a trade mission, is to craft them with resources. However, to do that, you must first scan the ship data to have access to its blueprint, listed in all Research stations, and in the Blueprints menu of your Personal console. Scanning data requires a Data Scanner that you acquire very early in the game, and the assignment of the associated hotkey. Scanning a ship is free and safe, but can be very tedious, as it only unlocks a small part of the Blueprint, and bigger ships require multiple scans of several ships of the same type to be fully unlocked. Fortunately, there's a faster way to unlock blueprints: Research stations. These stations allow you to study any ship in order to unlock their blueprints to all your Outposts. Each sector has a different research rate, so make sure to build them in the best sectors. Note that each project can be interrupted and resumed at any time. Research stations do not depend on people. Terran ships can only be researched in sectors that have Terran memory \(see your Galaxy map\).</t>
		<t id="1011">Maintenance</t>
		<t id="1012">In your Personal console, you'll see a Maintenance menu. It's very important that you keep an eye on this, because ship maintenance can easily get out of control. Military ships have a maintenance cost that increases over time if the ship remains undocked and travelling through space. That means that your ships are getting old and at some point, you might want to consider replacing them to lower your maintenance fees.\n\nAlternatively you can dock them to an Outpost that has the Dry Dock perk, which will slowly undo the permanent cost increase and makes current costs free.\n\nThe maintenance factor will always stay at 100% if the ship is equipped with a Mobile Maintenance Kit.</t>
		<t id="1013">Marines</t>
		<t id="1014">Boarding has been totally removed in Mayhem 3.</t>
		<t id="1015">Faction Relations</t>
		<t id="1016">The galaxy being a very dynamic place, faction relations are dynamic as well. Here are the rules:\n\n1. Factions are "neutral" when they have no invasion in progress, or if they signed a truce with each other. A truce can be signed after a faction conquers a sector and if there are no more invasions in progress. As the name suggests, it's very temporary.\n\n2. Factions are "friend" if they have an unbreakable alliance, or a coalition.\n\n3. Factions are "foe" when an invasion is in progress or if they have a total war, or a permanent war with the player.\n\nUnbreakable alliances and total wars are bound to the galaxy and are permanent. Permanent wars are player-side only. A permanent war can either be bound to a total war, or declared at any time by the player, to any faction. Declaring a permanent war against another faction will grant you 1 Favor point and 1 maximum perk for all your present and future Outposts.</t>
		<t id="1017">Invasions</t>
		<t id="1018">Invasions between other factions follow some strict rules:\n\nA faction cannot claim Protectorates or an already claimed sector. They also cannot claim Sith sectors and will avoid claiming too many unknown sectors when they can.\n\nClaims have a duration, at the end of which the invader will generally retreat.\n\nA newly conquered sector becomes a Protectorate for a few hours.\n\nBattle Groups are always the one that initiate an invasion. However, they can be reinforced by other fleets, such as Task Forces or Border Patrols.\n\nA sector is conquered by the claimer when all stations are destroyed. Company stations are ignored.\n\nYou, as player, automatically claim a sector when you destroy a station.\n\nDestroying a Protectorate station will cause a very high reputation penalty from all factions.\n\nIt is possible to completely annihilate a faction, but usually only you can do that.</t>
		<t id="1019">Squadrons</t>
		<t id="1020">To defend their territories, invade new sectors and harass the enemy, the main factions have several fleets of different types:\n\nBattle Group: they are used to invade new sectors. They generally tend to regroup to a safe location before claiming the sector they want to conquer, then move towards it.\n\nBorder Patrol: they are used to defend border sectors, giving priority to "hot sectors" \(see below\).\n\nEscort: they often escort civilian ships \(Workers\), otherwise they defend their current sector.\n\nPolice: they chase ships that have illegal wares onboard and they also attack hostile ships that are in adjacent sectors. By default, they defend their current sector.\n\nRearguard: they work the exact same way as Border Patrols, except that they focus on non-border sectors.\n\nTask Force: they're the most aggressive fleet. They can go in enemy territory to attack random ships even if they're not in war against them. However, their priority is to destroy enemy satellites and jump beacons, as well as assisting Battle Groups. They also have a reprisal mechanics: they will avenge fallen ships by trying to destroy the same value of enemy ships.\n\nApart from the reprisal system, there is also the Alert system. Each time a ship is attacked or something dangerous happens, an Alert is risen and the sector becomes "hot" for a short duration. Such sectors will always receive a special attention from most fleets.\n\nMost fleets will retreat when they feel overwhelmed. If that happens, they will go to the nearest safe Outpost and wait for reinforcements.</t>
		<t id="1021">Missiles</t>
		<t id="1022">Missiles have gone through a complete overhaul. The main idea is to reduce the confusion that exists between all the different types of missiles, and also to modify the vanilla gameplay by sticking a bit more to a believable model.\n\nThe first major change concerns the classification of missiles. You have three categories:\n\n- Fox 1: Semi active radar homing. These missiles are not heatseeker and require a locked target to be fired. They are rather slow and have a medium range. Fox 1 missiles can only be identified by CCDS MK1. The identification process can be done at high range and is mandatory for a chaff to be fired at the incoming missile.\n- Fox 2: Infrared. These missiles are heatseeker \(they can lock a missile instead of a ship\) and do not require a lock. They are fast and have a short range, but due to their nature, they can miss targets that have small heat signature such as fighters. Fox 2 missiles can only be identified by CCDS MK2, at medium range.\n- Fox 3: Active radar homing. These missiles are not heatseeker and do not require a lock. They have an optimal speed and a high range. Fox 3 missiles can only be identified by CCDS MK3, at short range.\n- Artillery missiles: Passive radar homing. These missiles can only be fired by M7M. They have the highest speed, the highest range, the highest damage and the highest price. Considering their wild nature, it is not possible to intercept artillery missiles with CCDS and chaffs. Like all other missiles however, they can be destroyed by laser fires, even though all missiles are a lot more resistant than in vanilla.\n\nAll missiles are racialized and every race has one of each type of missile.\n\nThe AI has been improved to fire missiles in the most efficient way possible, and also to keep good game performance and balanced gameplay. Therefore, the AI does not use missiles when out of sector \(your ships can\), and not against small fighters. The AI uses M8, and can also use M7M. These ships can always fire in Out-Of-Sector combat, like all of your ships. Each M8 has all CCDS built-in and can protect nearby allies.\n\nFighters cannot fire missiles. The only ship classes that can are M1, M2, M6, M7, M7M and M8. Artillery missiles can only be fired by M7M, while Fox missiles can be fired by all other classes.\n\nThere is no hotkey to manually fire a chaff. That's because CCDS have an extremely low chance of missing, and that you, as a human, cannot beat a radar.</t>
		<t id="1023">Hacking</t>
		<t id="1024">Hacking is a sneaky way to manipulate individual ships or steal lots of money from the owner.\n\nYou can partially disarm or damage the target. Shut down its shields, force it to retreat to a different sector, or even kill off the crew.\n\nAll ships have subsystems which are attached to a specific port. You can upload a virus from one of your hacking stations to target a specific port and its subsystem.\n\nFirst you need to uncover ports by scanning a ship with the hacking rootkit equipment. Scanning ships will mark them with a small dot in front of their name on the map.\nAll ships of the same type share the same port numbers, but each individual ship will have different ports opened or closed. Closed ports cannot be hacked.\nTo make a port vulnerable for a hack you need to research the port in a hacking station. This permanently unlocks it on all ships of the same type.\n\nNow you can use the rootkit again and install backdoors into the port. This consumes a hackerchip which can be crafted using the mobile factory equipment. Ships with backdoors are marked with a colored leading dot in the name and are part of your botnet. Virus upload is now possible at any time. A certain amount of botnet ships might be required for more powerful hacks and increased upload range requires other botnet ships in range to act as relays.\n\nEach hack has a certain risk to be detected. Possible consequences are retaliation hacks against your own ships or patching the port. Patched ports are permanently disabled. So for each Mayhem 3 playthrough and for each type of ship and subsystem you can only launch a limited amount of hacks. Eventually the ports will get patched.\n\n\nTips:\n\nTo draw the most benefit from this system you'll need a large botnet.\n\nInstalling a backdoor must not mean that you intend to hack a ship. Especially since you can loose all ships of the same type from your botnet if a hack gets detected\n\nYou can maintain a large botnet by installing backdoors into ships which are safe from physical destruction. Targets located deep inside a factions territory without pirate bases or Sith are usually a good idea. If there is no war nearby the ships will survive very long and enable powerful hacks against other targets.\n\nIf you just want to increase your botnet size you should target mining ships since they will always stay in a single sector. supply agents, civilian service ships and Rearguard Squadrons are also ok, as they will often at least somewhat stay in their factions territory and away from fights.\n\nTraders are less useful as their job is to travel between different factions and those can go to war at any time. Battlegroups, Task Forces, Police and Border Patrols are naturally bad choices because they actively seek trouble and get destroyed more frequently.</t>
		
		<!-- Mechanics -->
		<t id="2001">Ship Formations</t>
		<t id="2002">In Mayhem 3, all combat scripts have been rewritten from scratch. That means that some basic things have been redesigned. In that regard, combat tactics and ship formations have been overhauled. All formations, squadrons and fleets now have the same rules:\n\n1. The leader is at the center of the formation and only the leader runs the main script that tells him what to do in what situations.\n\n2. Followers are all the other ships that follow the leader and assist him. They will always try to protect the leader in priority, then attack his target, or assist other followers.\n\n3. Support ships are fighters that can be carried by a follower. As soon as they are in the carrier, and while the carrier is alive, they become independent from the formation. Their priority then becomes the protection and the assistance of the carrier. If the carrier dies, they will join the formation back, as standard followers. If the carrier is equipped with a Carrier Repair Module, the support ships will wait there while their hull is damaged.\n\nNote that wings are one of the few things - with turret scripts - that have been left untouched. Please report any problem you might encounter with them.</t>
		<t id="2003">Loot And Bailing Rate</t>
		<t id="2004">Loot, aka FLC for Fight Loot Chance is a Litcube's Universe feature that determines how much chance a ship has to drop shields and lasers if he's destroyed by a player's ship. However, in Mayhem, the FLC is a fixed rate that applies to every ship in the universe, including yours. The FLC level that you can see in the Pilot Status screen can be ignored. Freighters are special regarding loot. If they have a cargo, they will always drop a part of it, whoever destroys them.\n\nBailing rates in Mayhem have been decreased a lot. Abandoned ships are now limited in number, and Mayhem has its own bailing system.</t>
		<t id="2005">Personal Console</t>
		<t id="2006">Several hotkeys are crucial to the gameplay of Mayhem. The Personal console is by far the menu you will use the most. You can access it through a hotkey or through the Additional ship commands menu of your ships. Note that all custom hotkeys are deactivated when you are docked \(hardcoded limitation\).</t>
		<t id="2007">Gameplay Customization</t>
		<t id="2008">Many gameplay variables can be changed via a simple file: X3/addon/t/9972-L044.xml. Almost everything can be adjusted to your taste! This file is often referenced as "the t-file".</t>
		<t id="2009">Repair</t>
		<t id="2010">All ships are repaired over time for free when they are docked at any of your Outposts. They can also be repaired in a carrier if it's equipped with a Carrier Repair Module. However, the process is slower than in an Outpost.\n\nStations automatically repair themselves over time.</t>
		<t id="2011">New Equipment</t>
		<t id="2012">Lots of equipment are now included by default into all ships. However, for some of them like the Docking Computer and the Transporter Device, you will need to go through the Update ship menu from your Outpost's Hangar, and spend some coloured crystals to acquire them. These crystals come from mining, but they can also be transmuted from "normal" Crystals, ie. those produced in Crystal Fabs.\n\nPlease consult the Ship Equipment section of the encyclopedia to learn more about all the new equipments.</t>
		<t id="2013">Pirates</t>
		<t id="2014">Pirates have always been hiding in the darkest corners of the universe. Pirate bases can be randomly found in unknown sectors. They will create fighters and corvettes that will hunt down freighters and their precious cargo. You have to be careful about them, because the more territory you control, the more aggressive they'll get.\n\nPirate bases never respawn. You can dock to any Pirate base at anytime, even if they appear hostile. If you want to fix a bad reputation with a faction, you should dock to one of them.</t>
		<t id="2015">Jump Beacons</t>
		<t id="2016">You are the only faction that is able to craft and use Jump Beacons. To do so, you first have to build a Jumpdrive Core Factory, then use these cores to build a jump beacon in a ship that is equipped with a Mobile Factory Kit.\n\nBeacons act like gates: once two beacons are in place, your ships will automatically start using them and will always try to find the shortest path between their location and their destination. For performance reasons, Jump Beacons do not affect the 'Max. sector distance' range setting of your stations.</t>
		<t id="2017">Sith</t>
		<t id="2018">They have some heavily defended sectors, and they can spawn invasion fleets. However, the defenders are generic and will not be reinforced over time. Once they're destroyed, the defenders are not rebuilt.\n\nSith scout invaders will look for a way to strike deeper into your territory, instead of spawning from their stations.</t>
		<t id="2019">Difficulty</t>
		<t id="2020">You can only choose the difficulty setting of your game when you start it, through the initial survey. This setting affects the strength of Sith and OCV invasions, the number of Sith stations per sector \(hence the strength of defensive forces\), the strength of wandering Sith fleets that you can find in Unknown sectors, the number of pirates that are spawned from Pirate bases and the chance of spawning a Pirate base in an Unknown sector.</t>
		<t id="2021">Mercenaries</t>
		<t id="2022">Private companies not only have Traders, they also generate mercenaries over time. During their normal routine, these mercenaries will roam the galaxy, trying to be helpful where they can. Sometimes they will try to smuggle some illegal wares from a faction to another. If you happen to find one, and if you have a Police licence, they will turn Pirate and you will be able to gain a bounty by killing them. However, mercenaries can also be hired for your own benefit. If you decide to hire one, you will have to pay a regular fee and assign them one of your assets to protect or to escort. They can be dismissed at any time, but doing so below one hour is not optimal, as you need to pay a first single hiring fee that represents an hour of work.</t>
		<t id="2023">Sith Raids</t>
		<t id="2024">From time to time, Sith ships come from deep space to invade the empire that owns the most sectors in the galaxy.</t>
		<!-- Star Wars Mayhem 3 -->
		<t id="3001">Difference to Mayhem 3</t>
		<t id="3002">SWM3 is much more newcomer friendly than base Mayhem 3. Thats because nothing is really pressuring you to make progress and there is a much more consitent difficulty curve. This entire dynamic warfare part the mod stands for is mostly sleeping when you start a new game. It wakes up more and more as you to establish your own player empire which is able to actually take part in all these territorial struggles.\n\nBut this kind of logic also applies the other way around. Base Mayhem 3 had an especially difficult final phase and it was entirely in the player's hands to trigger it with a special mission. Beating the game required days of boring preparation grind because the OCV was so overpowered. And other factions couldn't help you in the slightest.\n\nThis kind of drag should be completely absent in SWM3.\nJust from expanding your own empire to a certain size can now trigger almost everything up to the final OCV invasions. And these kinds of enemies are much, much weaker. They are unlikely to be more than a small shakeup and will never threaten the entire galaxy. Here the focus is clearly on the main factions, their wars, and how you reacto to all this.\nYour playthrough will be shorter and more of the truly big things are happening to keep it interesting for longer.\n\nThe pacing adapts to more types of playstyles and unless you take certain actions the game doesn't demand that you make constant progress.\n\nThe earlygame lasts until 3 player owned sectors. That first part of your playthrough is much less intense than in base Mayhem 3. If you don't know anything about Mayhem yet take all the time you need to get familiar with the mechanics, commands and automation.\nAlmost all faction fleets, especially the offensive ones like Battlegroups, are intentionally weak in order to preserve the gameworld very close to its initial state. The idea behind that being that it isn't very fun if 1 faction completely takes over the universe before the player can't even do anything about it. Like the Xenon often would in base Mayhem 3\n\nBut don't let that initial peaceful atmosphere fool you! Lategame will have even bigger fleets than base Mayhem 3 and most factions will also be able to produce ships much more efficient than in the beginning.\n\nSo in essence you have an NPC progression which is completely linked to the player empire size. If you claim more sectors, the universe is slowly waking up and getting more active. This creates a much more consistent callenge. A slow and easy start and a more active and challenging end.\n\nIf you don't like that idea of a mostly peaceful beginning you can skip it with the new Midgame Quickstart.\n\n\nSWM3 removes all timer based difficulty scaling that base Mayhem 3 had.\nThat doesn't mean that there is no time pressure at all. Like if you go to war and an enemy Battlegroup invades you, then you obviously have limited time until they reach your sector and destroy your stations. But this kind of pressure has to be triggered by you. Nothing really major happens on its own even after a few days have passed.\n\n\nSome players might want more random chaos right from the beginning. In this case this might not be the best mod for you.\nBut even for this crowd SWM3 holds option B and especially option C in the new Mandalorian plot. Together with the Midgame Quickstart it creates an almost completely new experience. Much less economy grind, more warfare where you can also control which sectors your ally invades and what he does. The risk is much higher and the playthrough even higher paced and also shorter.</t>
		<t id="3003">Era System</t>
		<t id="3004">Your playthrough gets split up into 3 distinct phases. Early- mid- and lategame.\n\nThose phases change the composition of NPC fleets. Each faction follows its own progression path which is loosely inspired by Star Wars lore.\nThere are strengths and weaknesses for all factions. More detailed info can be found in the Faction Dossiers.\n\nReaching a new era might unlock different ship types and other obsolete designs won't be built anymore. The factions desire to build different fleets and receive better or worse production modifiers.\n\nBecause the 3 phases of your playthrough are so essential to the state of your gameworld, here are the two important trigger points:\n\n- midgame starts shortly after you have conquered 4 sectors.\n- lategame starts when you have terraformed 3 planets or when you own 20 sectors. Choosing option C in the Mandalorian plot activates a 2 day timer which will also trigger the lategame.\n\n\nThere is additional difficulty upscaling in the form of Sith and Pirate strength. The two are not really dependent on the phase system, but they do get stronger from the amount of player owned sectors which is quite similar. Other than it does with the main factions SWM3 generally doesn't ramp up the maximum strength that these two hostile factions can have. Overall they are weaker and less relevant.</t>
		<t id="3005">Hyperlanes</t>
		<t id="3006">The galaxy map marks certain sectors which contain Hyperlanes.\nWith default settings these hyperlanes only get used for an earlygame quest which unlocks the construction of jump beacons. In this quest the special sectors just represent a pool of targets to choose from where you must conquer just one.\n\n\nMayhem veterans who seek a challenge can activate a new mode which additionally restricts all your jump beacons to only work in these hyperlane sectors.\nThis is quite interesting because the galaxy suddenly gets additional landmarks which have drastic influence over your logistics, fleet movement and warfare.\nBut it generally makes your playthrough more difficult, as some areas can be very hard or even impossible to jump to. Certain other valuable hyperlane sectors might be occupied by very strong enemies. So this restricted jump beacon mode got disabled on default.\n\nBut it is recommended to try out for anyone who thinks that he has already mastered Mayhem 3!\n\nTo turn it on or off at anytime \(even during active savegames\) go to SWM3's own t-file 9973 and activate id 17.</t>
		<t id="3007">New Global Rules</t>
		<t id="3008">SWM3 sacrifices some of Mayhems typical random chaos in favor of a more stable gameworld, difficulty scaling and pacing.\nThe final part of your playthrough still has all the chaos from before, but until then there are boundaries. Especially if the player stagnates for too long and doesn't make progress with his empire building.\n\n\n- Major factions stop restraining themselves from claiming all available neutral sectors once you own 15 sectors or more. At this point everybody grabs what he can and you might have to get your hands bloody if you want to grow your empire further. Only waiting for more unknown sectors getting created just from the NPCs warring between each other won't work all that well anymore.\n\n- Any sort of galactic conquest from any faction \(including the player\) can only happen during the final phase of the playthrough. There is no indefinite delaying of a certain plot stage to make easier progress. When the player grows he eventually triggers the final phase.\nAnd if a major NPC faction already owns 40% of the entire galaxy it cannot claim any more sectors until phase 3 gets reached by the player. Until then it still builds all its fleets up to maximum allowed strength and when phase 3 finally triggers it can start many invasions from a super established and powerful position!\nThe Sith don't adhere to this rule and could overrun the galaxy. But this is extremely unlikely because they only get strong enough when the player grows and that also makes all other factions strong which usually keep the Sith in check. Mostly they can only overwhelm maybe a local area, but not the galaxy\n\n- it is much less likely that a pirate spawn creates M6 instead of fighters. This leads to much less danger in the early game, but if there are still pirate bases around when the player has a big empire himself, then there will be so many pirate ships spawning in one wave that when its actually a M6 wave, those ships can often stick around and you get a serious pirate infestation like in base Mayhem 3.</t>
		<t id="3009">Quality of Life</t>
		<t id="3010">- using carriers as fleet commanders works well now. The small ships which dock to them remain to be fleet followers and do not become support ships. That means they can still be controlled with the scanning range and other fleet settings like auto-repair. No longer the fighters docked to the commander fly ahead hundreds of kilometers as soon as he decides to attack something.\n\n- all ships come with the video googles preinstalled\n\n- the repair rate of larger ships is much higher\n\n- certain actions related to the hacking system mark the affected ship names with small leading indicators \(dots\):\n. \=scanned\n\033M. \=ship is part of your botnet\n\n- maintenance factors slowly get restored in outposts which have the drydock perk.\n\n- a smaller 5km scanning range option allows you to finetune certain fleets and maximize their efficiency by staying together to the last moment and only send fighters to attack enemies which are already very close.</t>

		<t id="10011">The Galactic Empire tends to have many powerful military fleets over the course of your entire playthrough. Especially their Rearguard and Border Patrol squadrons are solid, which can't be said for many other factions. This generally makes their defense very stable.\nBut their fleets are quite slow on the galactic level and they often have to deal with rebellious sectors, which are far apart and have to be reconquered. Their military campaigns often involve seemingly unstoppable invasion fleets but long travel times. They are strong, but predictable.\n\n\nIf you want to go into a permanent war with this faction before you have a strong player empire, then keeping your sectors at a great distance to theirs is probably your best and only viable survival strategy.</t>
		<t id="10012">\033G+++ consistently strong military\n\033G+ slightly larger starting territory\n\n\033R-- sectors more likely to defect\n\033R- slow fleets\n\033R- often busy hunting Rebels</t>
		<t id="10021">The New Republic suffers from crew shortages during what is essentially a reimagination of their lengthy and problematic founding period from the lore. They remain very weak for the longest part of your entire playthrough. But they absolutely have the potential to grow into a real powerhouse during the lategame, where they receive multiple huge buffs and instant benefits.\n\n\nThis faction is supposed to give you a lot of freedom in how you want to tackle them. They can be an easy early target to steal sectors from, or a tough ally for roleplay reasons.\nIn some rare cases they might even need your help to even survive and see the lategame \(altough that should be super rare and needs to involve the Sith\)nIn other cases just waiting very long and letting their incredible lategame buffs kick in might already allow them to conquer the entire galaxy without player help in a huge comeback, which can also turn them into a worthy endboss opponent for the player.\nBut if none of that appeals to you, you can always finish them off quite easily during the midgame.</t>
		<t id="10022">\033G+++ best lategame fleets and production\n\033G++ special lategame event\n\033G+ many powerful ship designs\n\n\033R-- low ship numbers until lategame\n\033R- slightly smaller starting territory</t>
		<t id="10031">Overall the Rebel Alliance probably has the weakest, but most mobile fleets. Their hidden hyperlane network allows them to quickly respond to any Hot sector with a host of small defense fleets.\nAll while no enemy sector is far enough to be safe from their unpredictable long range invasions. Their Battlegroups can usually cross the entire galaxy in mere minutes, which also allows them to retreat quickly if friendly outposts are nearby.\n\nThe Rebels are generally always on the run, especially from Imperial Battlegroups and they usually loose in big battles.\nBut they frequently get reinforced with new sectors which defect from other factions to join their cause. This creates a very fractured and isolated faction which seems to "wander" on the galaxy map as the game goes on. The Alliance always simmers in the background and is very hard to wipe out completely.\n\nThis faction will start to die during the lategame, when it slowly merges with the New Republic.\n\n\nIf you plan a permanent war with the Rebel Alliance be prepared to face an enemy who is much tougher than his very few sectors might indicate. Conquering a rebel sector is no easy task due to their hyperlane network which lets them respond so quickly. You basically can't outmaneuver them very well, even with jumpbeacons.\nAnd there is no place in the galaxy where you will be safe against their invasions. Their fleets are not the strongest and might not threaten your existence, but they can become really annoying.\nAnd then you can also have entirely new rebel sectors popping up unexpectedly, providing them with additional hyperlane access points to jump to.\n\nThis guerilla faction can only be defeated by wiping out every single rebel sector before the next batch wants to join them, or by reaching the lategame.</t>
		<t id="10032">\033G+++ new random sectors join frequently\n\033G++ hyperjump between all Outposts\n\033G++ efficient production \(secret donations\)\n\033G+ not invaded even if slightly larger\n\033G+ deep strikers\n\n\033R--- weak fleets, especially at gamestart\n\033R- very small and scattered territory\n\033R- never ignored by Imperial Battlegroups</t>
		<t id="10041">The Separatist Confederacy of Independent Systems is a swarmer type faction with a heavy focus on deploying masses of cheap droid fighters. This provides the bulk of their forces with unusually high damage output, but also makes them fragile and keeps their ship production running almost constantly.\nLater they also get a lot of capships, but the swarmer focus remains throughout your playthrough.\nThe CIS doesn't have any strong or weak phases and generally just ramps its power up when the player triggers a new phase.\n\n\nSome of their offensive fleets like Task Forces can consist of fighters only, which makes them annoying enemies who are very efficient in taking out soft targets like your satellites, freighters or jump beacons.</t>
		<t id="10042">\033G+ quick station kills during invasions\n\033G+ some squadrons travel very fast\n\n\033R- frequent losses in almost all battles</t>
		<t id="10051">The Republic is the most erratic faction in the game. It starts out as an economic powerhouse with a vast starting territory, but a pacifist fleet doctrine which is loosely based on the "Rusaan Reformation" from the lore \(highly demilitarized to preserve an age of peace and democracy\).\n\nThis military weakness gets resolved during the midgame, where they slowly transition to Clone Wars tech. During the midgame the Republic will perform the most intense military buildup of all factions, from almost nothing to a big powerhouse. With huge boosts to their production efficiency and desired fleet sizes. Although actually building all these new ships still takes them very long, leaving them vulnerable for huge territorial losses during the early- and the beginning midgame.\n\nThe lategame completely dooms this faction. It basically looses all its benefits and becomes extremely inefficient. At this point its only a matter of time until the Republic needs to make place for other factions.\n\n\nGoing into a permanent war with the Republic can be tempting but is a huge trap.\nThey start out super weak and you can literally take their sectors by force very early in the game. But their large starting territory makes it highly unlikely that you manage to completely cripple the entire faction before they can pull off their large midgame buildup. And after this point you may be set to get overwhelmed by a relentless wall of Venators.\nSo maybe keep your options alive and don't declare a permanent war. You can win lots of good sectors this way and when they finally get too strong you can still go to peace again.\nAnd then finish them off in the lategame or try to keep them alive in a roleplay challenge!</t>
		<t id="10052">\033G++ very large starting territory and economy\n\033G++ unique midgame boni \(Clone Wars\)\n\033G+ in earlygame not invaded even if larger\n\n\033R-- very weak starting military\n\033R-- seriously falls behind during lategame</t>
		<t id="10061">This part of the galaxy is plagued by hostile intruders with ships from the Old Sith Empire.\n\nHistorians have created the hypothesis that somewhere there is an automated factory, called the Starforge, which was built by the ancient Rakata. This device supposedly eats entire suns to extract their resources and then uses an unknown hyperlane phenomenon to send ships into our galaxy to haunt us.\n\nBut they seem to have limited bandwith and can only send so many ships at once. So far they weren't much of a threat.\nBut nobody could confirm this theory yet.</t>
		<t id="10062">\033G+ doesn't need resources\n\033G+ no maximum ship\/fleet limit\n\n\033R- limited waves at fixed time intervals\n\033R- only at Sith stations\n\033R- strength starts very weak\n\033R- scales with the size of the player empire</t>
		<t id="10071">This is a subbranch of the legions that the Starforge sends against our galaxy. They seem to have an independent method of transportation and can seemingly appear everywhere!</t>
		<t id="10072">\033G+ not dependent on Sith stations\n\n\033R- very long intervals between waves</t>
		<t id="10081">The criminal underworld in these parts couldn't form a very large organization yet. They have pirate bases in empty sectors and frequently start raids against the economy of all factions.</t>
		<t id="10082">\033G+ doesn't need resources\n\n\033R- no capships\n\033R- limited waves at fixed time intervals\n\033R- only at pirate stations or mandalorian outposts\n\033R- strength starts very weak\n\033R- scales with the size of the player empire</t>

		<t id="10191">When the Mandalorians got stranded here their heritage remained.\nThey are divided people and couldn't form their own faction yet.\n\nRumours have it that a terrorist organization is preparing to stage a coup, and that they are led by a new Mandalore.\n\nEventually this faction rises to power and given time, they could even threaten the galaxy. Their warlike nature demands conflict and the domination of everyone who is not respected and viewed as weak.\n\nTheir speciality are quite unpredictable attacks at sectors behind their territory border. Although their Battlegroups don't have any means of teleportation like the Rebel Alliance does and they need to take the long way.\n\n\nYou have a lot of freedom how you want to deal with this faction. When they arrive they are quite powerful and their outposts double down as alternative spawn locations for pirates. So eventually you might want to take them out. But you start out neutral and wait for the right moment.\nThere is also a special quest which allows you to form a very benefitial alliance or fight them.</t>
		<t id="10192">\033G+++ huge military headstart over all others\n\033G++ very efficient midgame production\n\033G+ neutral with pirates\n\033G+ deep strikers\n\n\033R--- very small starting territory\n\033R-- seriously falls behind during lategame\n\033R- outposts spread pirates</t>
